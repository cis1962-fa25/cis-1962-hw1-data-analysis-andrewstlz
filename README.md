# Homework 1 AI Synthesis Activity

Only complete one of the assignments below! You can delete the other assignment in this document once you've made your choice.

## Activity: You used AI

### Part 1

> Cite the usage by including screenshots, a text transcript, or a link to the conversation with your AI of choice. Make sure to include any context, instructions, and all the conversations you had with the AI.

[Here](https://chatgpt.com/share/68dc61bc-3b68-8001-8569-6d1dccf2e487) is the link to my conversation with AI.

### Part 2

> Write about why you used AI. Was there a gap in knowledge you wanted to fill? Were the answers through traditional search engines not adequate? Did you want to let AI help you format something in a quick manner?

> I wasn't very familiar with the syntax on JavaScript, especially with regards to object handling. For each part, I first attempted to complete the functions without using AI assistance. Then, I asked AI to evaluate my response and offer suggestions for improvements.

### Part 3

> Evaluate the AI's response. If you asked multiple questions, you can pick one of the responses the AI generated. Does the AI answer your question properly? Does it hallucinate any details? Could there be room to improve this response through manual editing? Did you accept this response fully or adapt parts of it into your work?

> When I asked for feedback on the Data Cleaning part of the assignment, AI told me to include multiple helper functions like toInt and isMissing and toFloat. But I had the understanding that these might be built in functions in Javascript, so I did some further research and realized that I can make it more efficient.

### Part 4

> If you used unfamiliar syntax or concepts generated by AI within your assignment, be sure to research them and explain what those concepts are to demonstrate your understanding.
> Yes, one such example is as follows:
> const rows = Array.isArray(cleaned) ? cleaned : cleaned?.rows || [];
> Array.isArray is a boolean value that checks whether cleaned itself is already an array. If cleaned is an array, we can just use it. Otherwise, we try to read cleaned.rows. If neither of those worked, fall back to an empty array.
> ? cleaned : cleaned?.rows || []; is the ternary conditional we learnt in class. If cleaned is an array, this is saying we can just call it and use it. Otherwise, we try to read cleaned.rows. If neither works, we fall back to an empty array.
> **_ You do NOT need to use the AI suggestion within your final submission, if your code already works properly. If the scope of your inquiry in this activity leads you to replace parts of your code, switch to the other version of this activity instead. _**
